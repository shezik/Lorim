## Progress
I'm going to call it done. Lacks the ability to PM, customize and save username, etc.

There are better instant messengers out there, but I haven't seen an open-source one that's good, which is the motivation of this *(crap)* project.

Remind me if you see one out in the wild. ;)<br>
*(Yeah I know about [disaster.radio](https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio)... that is not for casual use tho, and its maintenance has halted.)*
